### Projects

#### J Doodle Grade Calculator
 ![Project 1](Images/Grading_Calculator.png)
 - I decided to make each personality type a variable and add one point to it each time its corresponding answer was chosen, then display the personality type with the most points.

#### Access Grade Calculator
 ![Project 2](Images/Apporto_Grading_Calculator.png)
 - This helps me determine what grade I need on an assignment to get a certain class grade, when I only know the scores I got on previous assignments. I also can predict my grade.

***
#### Personality Quiz

 - Instead of just giving you one class grade, it averages your grades for five classes per semester, and 6 semesters total, and provides you with a more professional looking and comprehensive summary than Python.
